\section[What is Caching]{What is Caching}
Caching data means to store frequently accessed data in a location that is easy and fast to access (usually in RAM). 
The reason why caching is used is to ultimately increase the performance and efficiency when retrieving data. 
Data in the database are usually stored in a disk, which could be a hard drive or an SSD, which usually takes more time to process I/O. 
Caching could help decrease the amount of time to process this data significantly. One might suggest then why not put all the data in the cache, 
but this would not work since the cache could not store a lot of data as much as the database does. The cost of the hardware of the cache is much more expensive, 
and as the size of the cache increases, the search time will also increase, decreasing the speed and defeating the whole purpose of caching. 
Caching can be used at several levels. This article will mainly focus on caching in databases and web pages. 
There are multiple strategies that could be used when caching these two areas. Another important part of caching is the invalidation strategies. 
Deciding when the cache expires and when it updates could affect the performance and data consistency. Choosing the right technique in the given situation will be essential.
