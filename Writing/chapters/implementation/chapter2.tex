\chapter{Implementation}\label{text}
As discussed in the theory chapter, there are numerous design choices that must be made when developing a software. This chapter 
outlines the design choices that are made both in the backend and the frontend side of the project. The design choices 
made in the backend will focus on the reasons why certain decisions were made in the software architecture, database design choices, and database caching systems.
The frontend section examines the decisions regarding frontend caching in detail, along with other relevant implementation considerations.
